1. Project Overview
A comprehensive, interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze drug sales data, enabling stakeholders to visualize key metrics, demographic breakdowns, and trends over time to support strategic decisions.

2. Problem Statement
Stakeholders requested visibility into pharmaceutical sales performance by drug, geography, customer demographics, and timeâ€”aiming to uncover top-performing products, sales channels, customer trends, and seasonality.

3. Dataset Description
Typically includes three CSV files:

Customers.csv â€“ Customer demographics (CustomerID, Age, Gender, Country, etc.)

Drugs.csv â€“ Product info (DrugID, DrugName, UnitPrice, Cost, Treats, etc.)

Sales.csv â€“ Transactions (SaleID, DrugID, CustomerID, UnitsSold, SaleDate, BuyerType, etc.)

4. Solution & Approach
Load and clean data using Power Query Editor (remove duplicates, correct types).

Build a star schema data model in Power BI linking lookup tables (Customers, Drugs) to the fact table (Sales).

Create interactive visuals and slicers for time (year/quarter/month).
